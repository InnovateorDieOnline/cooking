    <p>The source code for this site good, bad, or otherwise is all mine. 
      However, in order to build it I used several great open source 
      tools and frameworks. The code was written in JavaScript and 
      it uses Node.js and Express.js. The entire source code for 
      this site is available on github.</p>

    <p>The CSS for the site is based almost entirely on 
      <a href="http://www.zurb.com/playground/off-canvas-layouts" target="_blank">ZURB's Off Canvas Layouts</a> which in turns uses ZURB's foundation framework. 
      This is what allows the site adapt so nicely to both, big screens 
      and small devices (like phones and tablets.)</p>

    <p>The favicon with the silverware was taken from 
      <a href="http://www.favicon.cc/?action=edit_image&file_id=513188" target="_blank">favicon.cc</a>.</p>

    <p>Starting June 26th, 2013 the site is hosted at <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/" target="_blank">Windows Azure</a>. </p>
